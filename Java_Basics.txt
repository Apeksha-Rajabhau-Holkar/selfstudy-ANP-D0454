1. WAP for creating a mini calculator for performing a particular operation based on user choice. ex. if the user will select the addition operation then the output should be the addition of the given two nos.

package com.demo;

import java.util.*;

public class Lab2 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter First Number :");		//Enter first no. from user
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		
		System.out.println("Enter Second Number :");		//Enter second no from user
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		
		System.out.println("Enter Operator Number :");		//Enter operator from user
		char Operator = sc.next().charAt(0);
		
		switch(Operator) {
		//Perform Addition Operation or calculation addition of two numbers
		case '+': System.out.println("Addition :"+(a + b));
				  break;
				 
	    // Calculating Subtraction
		case '-': System.out.println("Substraction :"+(a - b));
		  		  break;
		  
		//Calculating Product
		case '*': System.out.println("Multiplication :"+a * b);
		          break;
		  
	    // Calculating Division of two numbers
		case '/': System.out.println("Division :"+(a / b));
				  break;
		  
		//Calculate Reminder
		case '%': System.out.println("Reminder :"+(a % b));
		  		  break;
		  	
		//perform default operation if all above case is not matched
		default: System.out.println("Wrong Operator");
		  
		}
		
		
	}

}

output:
Enter First Number :
26
Enter Second Number :
25
Enter Operator Number :
+
Addition :51


2. WAP for creating a banking Application .you have to take input from the user whether the user wants to deposit, withdraw, or find a current balance.

	package com.demo;
	import java.io.*;

	public class Bank {

	public static void main(String[] args)  throws IOException {
		        double balance = 0.0;
		        
		        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

		        while (true) {
		            System.out.println("\nBanking Application");  //printing Banking application 
		            System.out.println("1. Deposit");
		            System.out.println("2. Withdraw");
		            System.out.println("3. Check Balance");
		            System.out.println("4. Exit");
		            
		            //give input from user whether they want deposit,withdraw,balance check.
		            System.out.print("Enter your choice: ");
		            int choice = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());

		            switch (choice) {
		                case 1: System.out.print("Enter amount to deposit: ");
		                        double depositAmount = Double.parseDouble(br.readLine());
		                        balance += depositAmount;
		                        System.out.println("Deposit successful. New balance: " + balance);
		                        break;
		                        
		                case 2: System.out.print("Enter amount to withdraw: ");
		                        double withdrawAmount = Double.parseDouble(br.readLine());
		                        if (withdrawAmount > balance) {
		                        System.out.println("Insufficient balance.");
		                        } else {
		                        balance -= withdrawAmount;
		                        System.out.println("Withdrawal successful. New balance: " + balance);
		                        }
		                        break;
		                        
		                case 3: System.out.println("Current balance: " + balance);
		                        break;
		                        
		                case 4: System.out.println("Exiting application. Goodbye!");
		                		System.exit(0);
		                		break;
		                		
		                default: System.out.println("Invalid choice. Please try again.");
		            }
		        }
		    }
		}
